# Week 7

## End Goal

* Create an algorithm that reads in two GPS points and creates the most efficient 3D path for a UAV to traverse the points given concerning the time, distance, and energy usage from aerially obtained LiDAR scans and the ability to change course mid-flight if the best path is obstructed.

## Progress Report
