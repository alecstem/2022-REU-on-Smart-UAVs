# Week 2

## Progress Report
* Took point cloud data from LiDAR scans, converted it into a grid, and wrote code to seperate layers based on height.
* Implemented A* on each height layer and created a visualization.
* Performed literary analysis on our topic and adjacent topics.

## Obstacles

* Initially wanted to use satellite imagery but had to switch to point clouds obtained from LiDAR to retrieve height data.
* Creating the images from a grid of ones and zeros took a while due to matching issues.

## Objectives

* Make A* smarter (add optimization, height checks, etc.)
* Finish OpenTopography API integration
