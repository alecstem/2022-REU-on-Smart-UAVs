# Week 4

## End Goal

* Create an algorithm that reads in two GPS points and creates the most efficient 3D path for a UAV to traverse the points given with regard to the time, distance, and energy usage from aerially obtained LiDAR scans and the ablity to change course mid-flight if the best path is obstructed.

## Progress Report
* Added primitive object detection / avoidance in the simulation using euclidian distance.
* Current avoidance procedure: sample best avoidance path at every waypoint. If object is encountered, move to avoidance path and then recalculate A*.
* Began working on presentation slides for next week.
