### Shortest Path from Satellite Imagery for Low-flight Operation
* We talked about this.
    1. Use a neural net to process satellite imagery.
    1. Create a grid with likely obstacles based on altitude.
    1. Compute shortest path w/ added buffer depending on drone size.
    1. Send coordinates to drone.
    

### Fire Avoidance Algorithm using Heat/Thermal Sensing
* A lot of people are writing about fire DETECTION algos, not avoidance.
* *Temperature Sensor* 
    * How hot is too hot? We could compare average temperature data by location and note extremes (because this may be a fire)
* *Thermal Sensor* 
    * Use computer vision to identify areas above a certain threshold of heat.
    * Have drone avoid area. 
    * Could use to show where water should be applied first.
* This will be hard to test.
