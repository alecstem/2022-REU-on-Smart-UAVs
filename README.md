### Shortest Path from Satellite Imagery for Height Restricted Operation
* We talked about this.
    1. Use a method to process satellite imagery.
    1. Create a grid with likely obstacles based on altitude.
    1. Compute shortest path w/ added buffer depending on drone size.
    1. Send coordinates to drone.
